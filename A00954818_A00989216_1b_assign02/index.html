      <h1>The Chinese Zodiac</h1>
    	<p>
        The Chinese animal zodiac, or shengxiao, is a repeating
        cycle of 12 years, with each year being represented by an
        animal and its reputed attributes. Traditionally these
        zodiac animals were used to date the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each one has its own animal sign according to the year
        of the birth (calculated according to the Chinese lunar
        calendar).The Chinese Zodiac consists of twelve animal signs.
        People under different signs have unique characters and fortune.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first group is Chinese six domestic animals: horse, ox, goat,
        pig, dog and chicken. They are raised and trained for economic and other
        purposes playing important roles in Chinese agriculture. In people's
        traditional view, a family will have a flourishing population and live
        happily if their domestic animals are all thriving. When the Chinese
        spring festival comes, people always wish their domestic animals thrive
        in the coming year. So, due to their importance, these six animals must
        be chosen in the 12 animals.
      </p>
    	<p>
        The second group is wild animals that are well known by the people
      	and closely related to people's life. They are tiger, rabbit, monkey,
      	rat and snake. Among them, tiger and snake are feared, rat is detested,
      	and rabbit and monkey are loved by the people. These animals are commonly
      	seen in people's life and easily remembered and chosen into the 12 animals.
      </p>
    	<p>
        The last group includes one animal - dragon, the traditional mascot of
      	Chinese people. It is the only fictitious animal in 12 ones. Chinese people
      	think they are descendents of the dragon and have a special emotion with it.
      	It is a deified animal symbolizing auspicious, omnipotent ability and the
      	loftiest power. So, dragon is indispensable.
